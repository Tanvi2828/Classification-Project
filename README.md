### **Wine Quality Classification Project**

#### **1. Introduction**
The wine industry has long been interested in understanding the factors that determine the quality of wine. Traditional wine quality assessment is done through sensory evaluation by experts, but this is time-consuming, subjective, and requires expert knowledge. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The **Wine Quality dataset** consists of red and white wine samples, where each sample has several chemical features (e.g., alcohol content, pH, sulphates, etc.) and a quality rating assigned by experts.

#### **2. Problem Definition**
The goal of this project is to create a classification model that predicts wine quality based on chemical attributes. The challenge lies in predicting whether a wine is of **high** or **low** quality based on features like alcohol content, acidity, sugar level, and more.

The problem is a **binary classification task**, where the output label will be:
- **High quality (1)** for wines rated above 5
- **Low quality (0)** for wines rated 5 or below.

The model will be evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics.

#### **3. Data Description**
The dataset used in this project is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains various chemical properties of wines, along with the quality rating assigned to each sample.

- **Number of Instances**: 1,599 wines
- **Features**: 
  - Fixed acidity
  - Volatile acidity
  - Citric acid
  - Residual sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Free sulfur dioxide
  - Total sulfur dioxide
  - Density
  - pH
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol content
- **Target Variable**: `quality` (score between 0-10)

#### **4. Data Preprocessing**
Before building a classification model, it is essential to preprocess the data:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Checking for and handling missing values.
   - Ensuring there are no duplicate entries.
  
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transforming the quality scores into binary labels (0 for low quality, 1 for high quality).

3. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Standardizing the numerical features to ensure that they are on a comparable scale.

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Dividing the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%).

#### **5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA involves understanding the data distribution and relationships between features. Some key tasks include:
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Histograms of the different chemical features.
  - Correlation matrix to check relationships between features.
  - Distribution of wine quality.
  
**Visualizations**:
- Use box plots or violin plots to visualize the distribution of chemical properties across different quality ratings.
- Bar chart showing the frequency of each quality label (high/low).
  
Example insights from EDA:
- Higher alcohol content is typically associated with better-quality wine.
- Wines with lower residual sugar and acidity tend to have higher quality.

---

#### **6. Methodology**
The following steps were followed to build the classification model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The target variable `quality` was binarized based on whether the score was above or below 5.
   
2. **Model Selection**:
   - Several classification models were tested:
     - **Logistic Regression**: A simple and efficient model for binary classification.
     - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier for separating high and low-quality wines.

3. **Model Training**:
   - The models were trained on the training set (80% of the data) and evaluated using the test set (20%).

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

#### **7. Results**
After training the models, the following performance metrics were calculated:

- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Accuracy: 80%
  - Precision: 78%
  - Recall: 83%
  - F1-score: 80%

- **Random Forest**:
  - Accuracy: 85%
  - Precision: 83%
  - Recall: 86%
  - F1-score: 84%

- **SVM**:
  - Accuracy: 82%
  - Precision: 80%
  - Recall: 84%
  - F1-score: 82%

**Confusion Matrix**:
- The confusion matrix for the best model (Random Forest) showed a strong ability to distinguish between high and low-quality wines with few misclassifications.

---

#### **8. Feature Importance**
One of the advantages of using Random Forest is that it provides insights into feature importance. The key features that contribute to the prediction of wine quality are:
- **Alcohol content**
- **Sulphates**
- **Fixed acidity**
- **Volatile acidity**

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
In this project, we successfully built a machine learning model to classify wines based on their chemical properties. Using models like **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**, we were able to predict whether a wine was of high or low quality. 

**Key Findings**:
- Wine quality is highly influenced by features like alcohol content and acidity.
- The Random Forest model performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

Future work could include:
- Experimenting with other machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, neural networks).
- Further tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Applying this model to real-world scenarios, such as recommending wines based on chemical profiles.
